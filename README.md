# Cybersecurity-Incident-Tracking-System-
The Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System is a database management system for tracking, managing, and analyzing cybersecurity incidents within an organization. It centralizes the recording, analysis, and resolution of security incidents, enhancing the organization's ability to respond to and mitigate cyber threats effectively.


**Abstract** 
In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations face an ever-increasing number of 
cybersecurity incidents that pose significant threats to their sensitive data and critical infrastructure. 
To effectively address these challenges, organizations require efficient incident management and 
response mechanisms. This research paper presents the design and implementation of a Cybersecurity 
Incident Tracking System, a comprehensive database management system aimed at improving 
incident tracking, analysis, and resolution within organizations. 
The Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System serves as a centralized repository for recording, 
analyzing, and resolving cybersecurity incidents. It offers a range of features to streamline the incident 
management process, including user management, incident logging, incident classification and 
prioritization, investigation and analysis, incident resolution, reporting and metrics generation, 
integration with security tools, and robust security and audit functionalities. 
User management functionalities allow administrators to create and manage user accounts with 
different roles and access levels. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and 
manipulate sensitive information, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the system. 
Incident logging enables authorized users to record cybersecurity incidents with essential details such 
as incident type, severity, date and time of occurrence, affected systems, and a concise description. 
This information forms the foundation for incident analysis and resolution, aiding in the identification 
of patterns and trends. 
To efficiently allocate resources and prioritize incident response efforts, the system incorporates 
incident classification and prioritization mechanisms. Incidents can be categorized based on 
predefined criteria, allowing incident responders to focus on critical issues first and allocate resources 
accordingly. 
The investigation and analysis features facilitate a thorough examination of cybersecurity incidents. 
Users can document the investigation process, including the collection of evidence, actions taken, and 
findings. Additionally, the system provides data analysis capabilities to identify patterns, trends, and 
potential vulnerabilities, enabling proactive security measures. 
Incident resolution functionalities allow users to track the progress of incident resolution efforts, 
assign tasks, set deadlines, and update task statuses. Collaboration among incident responders is 
encouraged, ensuring timely resolution of incidents and minimizing the impact on organizational 
operations. 
Reporting and metrics generation capabilities enable users to generate reports on various aspects, such 
as incident frequency, resolution time, common attack vectors, and lessons learned. These reports aid 
in decision-making, resource allocation, and the implementation of proactive security measures to 
prevent future incidents. 
The system can integrate with existing security tools and systems, such as intrusion detection systems 
and firewalls, to automate incident logging and capture relevant data. This integration enhances the 
accuracy and efficiency of incident management and reduces manual effort. 
Security and audit functionalities are prioritized to protect sensitive data. The system incorporates 
access controls, encryption of sensitive information, and regular backups to safeguard against data 
loss. An audit log is maintained to track user activities, ensuring accountability and facilitating 
forensic analysis if required. 
In conclusion, the Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System presented in this research paper offers a 
robust and comprehensive solution for organizations to enhance their incident management and 
response capabilities. By providing a centralized repository, effective incident tracking and analysis, 
efficient resolution workflows, and comprehensive reporting functionalities, the system empowers 
organizations to respond swiftly and effectively to cybersecurity incidents, mitigating risks and 
safeguarding their critical assets.
