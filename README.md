The Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System serves as a centralized repository for recording, 
analyzing, and resolving cybersecurity incidents. It offers a range of features to streamline the incident 
management process, including user management, incident logging, incident classification and 
prioritization, investigation and analysis, incident resolution, reporting and metrics generation, 
integration with security tools, and robust security and audit functionalities. 
User management functionalities allow administrators to create and manage user accounts with 
different roles and access levels. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and 
manipulate sensitive information, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the system. 
Incident logging enables authorized users to record cybersecurity incidents with essential details such 
as incident type, severity, date and time of occurrence, affected systems, and a concise description. 
This information forms the foundation for incident analysis and resolution, aiding in the identification 
of patterns and trends. 
To efficiently allocate resources and prioritize incident response efforts, the system incorporates 
incident classification and prioritization mechanisms. Incidents can be categorized based on 
predefined criteria, allowing incident responders to focus on critical issues first and allocate resources 
accordingly. 
The investigation and analysis features facilitate a thorough examination of cybersecurity incidents. 
Users can document the investigation process, including the collection of evidence, actions taken, and 
findings. Additionally, the system provides data analysis capabilities to identify patterns, trends, and 
potential vulnerabilities, enabling proactive security measures. 
Incident resolution functionalities allow users to track the progress of incident resolution efforts, 
assign tasks, set deadlines, and update task statuses. Collaboration among incident responders is 
encouraged, ensuring timely resolution of incidents and minimizing the impact on organizational 
operations. 
Reporting and metrics generation capabilities enable users to generate reports on various aspects, such 
as incident frequency, resolution time, common attack vectors, and lessons learned. These reports aid 
in decision-making, resource allocation, and the implementation of proactive security measures to 
prevent future incidents. 
The system can integrate with existing security tools and systems, such as intrusion detection systems 
and firewalls, to automate incident logging and capture relevant data. This integration enhances the 
accuracy and efficiency of incident management and reduces manual effort. 
Security and audit functionalities are prioritized to protect sensitive data. The system incorporates 
access controls, encryption of sensitive information, and regular backups to safeguard against data 
loss. An audit log is maintained to track user activities, ensuring accountability and facilitating 
forensic analysis if required. 
In conclusion, the Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System presented in this research paper offers a 
robust and comprehensive solution for organizations to enhance their incident management and 
response capabilities. By providing a centralized repository, effective incident tracking and analysis,

safeguarding their critical assets.

**Proposed Method**

Proposed Methods 
1. User Management: - Old Method: Traditional user management involved manual creation and management of user 
accounts, typically through an administrative interface. Access levels and permissions were assigned 
manually. - New Method: Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system, where users are assigned roles 
based on their responsibilities and access requirements. This method automates user management, 
simplifies access control, and allows for more granular permissions. 
2. Incident Logging: - Old Method: Incidents were logged manually using spreadsheets or text documents, which often led 
to inconsistencies and errors. Incident details had to be entered manually, which was time-consuming 
and prone to human error. - New Method: Implement an automated incident logging system that integrates with security tools 
and systems. This method automatically captures incident data from various sources, such as intrusion 
detection systems and log management systems, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. 
3. Incident Classification and Prioritization: - Old Method: Incidents were manually classified and prioritized based on predefined criteria. This 
process relied heavily on human judgment and was prone to inconsistencies and biases. 
- New Method: Utilize machine learning algorithms to automatically classify and prioritize incidents. 
These algorithms can analyze incident attributes, historical data, and patterns to assign appropriate 
severity levels and prioritize incidents based on their potential impact and urgency. 
4. Investigation and Analysis: - Old Method: Incident investigations were performed manually, involving data collection, analysis, 
and documentation using traditional methods. This process was time-consuming and relied heavily on 
human expertise. - New Method: Implement advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning and natural 
language processing, to automate incident investigation and analysis. These techniques can analyze 
large volumes of incident data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and generate insights to aid 
incident responders in their investigation process. 
5. Incident Resolution: - Old Method: Incident resolution involved manual assignment of tasks, communication through 
email or other channels, and manual tracking of task statuses. This method lacked real-time visibility 
and often led to delays in incident resolution. - New Method: Implement a collaborative incident resolution platform that allows for automated task 
assignment, real-time communication, and tracking of task statuses. This platform can facilitate 
seamless collaboration among incident responders, ensuring timely resolution and improving overall 
efficiency. 
6. Reporting and Metrics: - Old Method: Reports and metrics were generated manually using spreadsheets or other tools. Data 
had to be extracted, manipulated, and formatted manually, making the process time-consuming and 
error-prone. - New Method: Develop a reporting and metrics module within the incident tracking system that 
automates the generation of reports and metrics. This module can extract relevant incident data, apply 
predefined algorithms and templates, and generate comprehensive reports and metrics in real-time. 
7. Integration with Security Tools: 
- Old Method: Integration with security tools involved manual configuration and data extraction from 
various sources. This method required significant effort and was prone to configuration errors. - New Method: Utilize application programming interfaces (APIs) and standardized protocols to 
establish seamless integration with security tools. This approach simplifies the integration process, 
ensures data accuracy, and allows for real-time data exchange between the incident tracking system 
and security tools. 
8. Security and Audit: - Old Method: Security and audit measures were implemented manually, such as defining access 
controls, encrypting sensitive information, and maintaining audit logs manually. This method was 
susceptible to human errors and required significant manual effort. - New Method: Implement automated security and audit measures within the incident tracking system. 
This includes leveraging encryption algorithms, implementing robust access controls and 
authentication mechanisms, and automating the generation and maintenance of audit logs. 
Additionally, use advanced security measures like multi-factor authentication and anomaly detection 
to enhance system security.
